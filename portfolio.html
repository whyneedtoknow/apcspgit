    <h1>   For our first project we decided to make hangman. We made a list of words that the program would randomly select for the player to try to guess. The player would input his/her guess into the console and depending on the guess the program would react differently. If the guess is wrong, the guesses value would go down by one and the hangman would slowly begin to get drawn in. If the guess is correct, the program will slowly draw the words as you get closer to the answer. At the end there is a win/loss screen which features a text box and an animated floating face.</h1>
